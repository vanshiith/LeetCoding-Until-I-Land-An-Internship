# LeetCoding-Until-I-Land-An-Internship

I am a rising sophomore, and my goal before college starts is to be comfortable with finding patterns in problems concerning each data type.

This is my repo tracking my leet-code practice. I am planning to do multiple 30 days of LeetCode challenges. I will start off my first few problems as the easy difficulty ones. And I am also trying to find the ones that are most frequently asked in interviews.

If this is something you would want to do, then tag along and we can code together.
